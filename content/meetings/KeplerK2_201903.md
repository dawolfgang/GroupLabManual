### Monday, March 4, 2019

**Bill Borucki** - Kepler was rejected 4 times before being accepted!
Time #1 - worries that detectors wouldn’t work
Time #2 - mission too costly
Time #3 - haven’t demonstrated that can process 10,000 stars in an automated way (too much for manual analysis)
Time #4 - haven’t demonstrated that can reach 10 ppm
…. and after addressing these criticisms one by one the mission was selected and was an enormous success (and not just for exoplanets!)

**Katelynn McCalmont** - engineer’s view of the K2 mission; how to correct for the drifting; the drama at the end of the mission with watching the fuel tank pressure drop; running on fumes for C19.  Managed to get all the science data off the satellite, though!!

**Geert Barentsen** - 21 scientific opportunities with Kepler and K2. The missions are done taking data, but the science is far from over!!  https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12554

**Mia Lundkvist** - asteroseismology of solar-type stars.  Typical Gaia uncertainty on Kepler stellar radii are 5%; for asteroseismology is 3% (CKS is 12%).  
Highlighted individual systems: Kepler-444, Kepler-10.  
Ensemble studies: 1) Constrain the obliquity of exoplanet systems by comparing power in the m=0 vs. m=+/-1 modes for l=1.  2) Eccentricities from transit duration & knowing the stellar radius well (Van Eylen papers - eccentricity distribution is wider for single-planet systems).  3) Evaporation; looking at the desert (defined as 2-4 R_Earth and >650 times the flux incident at Earth (~4.5 day periods)).  No asteroseismic stars in this region … Also the evaporation valley; with asteroseimic sample can determine the slope of the valley - is negative, consistent with evaporation (see next talk).  We’re not done with asteroseismic analysis of Kepler data - there will be more targets that they can analyze the oscillations of.

**Vincent Van Eylen** - understanding planet formation through asteroseismology.  Focusing on photoevaporation, as enabled by improved precision of asteroseismology (quotes 2%, versus spectroscopy + Gaia, quoted at 10%).  Owen & Wu 2017 - envelopes between 1 and 10% are most stable to photoevaporation.  Gets a negative slope using asteroseismic stellar radii -> photoevaporation  Also location matches terrestrial core composition.  Emptiness of valley suggests homogeneous core composition (but also limited sample size . . .).  Reassess this with TESS, find a planet in the gap!

**Hilke Schlichting** - core-powered mass loss as an explanation for the evaporation valley (versus photoevaporation).  Because the envelope acts as a thermal blanket while the core is accreting gas from the disk, the core doesn’t lose its residual formation heat until the envelope cools substantially (this takes Gyrs).  Above envelope mass fractions ~10%, cooling dominated by envelope; below dominated by core.  To keep those small envelopes around, the loss timescale > cooling timescale.  Gupta & Schichting, submitted: slope is -0.1, about what Vincent found.  Also looked at dependence on stellar properties, particularly mass (this mass loss mechanism depends on the bolometric luminosity, not on XUV like photoevaporation): valley is at larger radius around larger mass stars (slope as a function of M_star is ~0.3).  This is consistent with Fulton & Petigura, 2018, and is the opposite of photoevaporation (because XUV stronger for low-mass stars, should be able to strip even larger cores, and slope with M_star would be negative . . . but from Gaidos: this isn’t quite true - the ratio of XUV-to-bolometric is higher, but not overall XUV, so can’t discount photoevaporation.  Hilke points to Wu 2018 about trend between stellar and planet masses . . . hmmmmmmm.).  Also looked at [Fe/H] . . . some dependence for planets with envelopes still because of the role of opacity in envelope constraction.  

**Travis Berger** - precise characterization of Kepler stars and planets using Gaia DR2.  Presented his paper (before that, Mathur et al. 2017 was the updated Kepler stellar properties catalog).  He finds that the Kepler stellar sample consists of: Main sequence dwarfs (67%), Subgiants (21%), Red giants (12%).  Using the Gaia data increases the Kepler stellar radii by 12% (median increase).  Also sees binary sequence among stars.  Among the planets, sees the evaporation valley; 74 planets in Mia’s defined evaporation desert.  Also >100 planets of all sizes in habitable zone.  Also cool inflated Jupiters … still young?  In preparation: looking at masses and ages of the Kepler targets.  Ages: distribution peaks at 3 Gyr.

**BJ Fulton** - revisiting the radius gap with DR2.  Talking about the stellar mass dependence of the gap referred to by Hilke.  Suspected that with Gaia, gap would be deeper and narrower than could measure with CKS (stellar radius uncertainties dilute the gap). Uses spectroscopic T_eff (rather than T_eff from colors as with Berger).  Turns out gap looks nearly the same in depth/width in 1D, but cleans up in 2D (as function of period).  Location of gap is consistent with cores made of a fraction of silicates and iron.  Other than photoevaporation, other explanations for gap: core-heating (Hilke’s talk), pebble accretion, giant impacts, outgassing of a few %.  Goes into stellar mass dependence.  But what’s the cause of this dependence?  Could be mass, metallicity, or age given correlations between properties in the Kepler target star sample.

**Matteo Cantiello** - magnetic fields in stars as revealed by Kepler. There’s a suppression of mixed modes in some stars - possibly due to magnetic fields.

**Angela Santos** - signatures of magnetic activity in seismic data of Kepler solar-type stars.  Talking about 100-day timescales for the magnetic cycles.  KIC 5184732; KIC 8006161 - find that these cycles are not constant period.  The maximum shift in frequency (in micro-Hz) of these stars is higher for hotter stars, in agreement with theory.  Also increases as metallicity increases.  60% of stars have these frequency shifts.

**Ellianna Schwab Abrahams** - fundamental properties of M-dwarfs in Kepler.  Using Gaia and a color cut informed by M-dwarfs spectroscopically confirmed with SDSS.  Also calculate own masses; find that the masses are ~25% larger than in the Kepler Input Catalog.  Use this update radii and temperature. Also look at magnetic properties of M-dwarfs.  Measured >800 new rotation periods based on McQuillan 2013; see bimodal distribution: most are slow rotators, but there are some rapid rotators.  Comparing Kepler to M-Earth rotation rates (from Newton paper), see that the gap becomes wider for lower-mass stars.  Also applying to K2.  In total, confirmed > 30000 M-dwarfs in Kepler and K2.

**Michael Gully-Santiago** - Stellar Surface Inhomogeneities can bias transit-derived exoplanet densities.  David et al. 2019 - a planet transiting a heavily spotted stars.  Kepler can measure the variation due to star spots, but not the total amount of light that is lost by star spots.  What is the typical ratio of total spot coverage to the Kepler amplitude (to get at this missing light)?  Answer is unconstrained . . . anywhere from 1 to 100, depends on whether you assume spots are distributed symmetrically or not.  So what happens if it’s really large?  Nontrivial mapping from depth to Rp/Rstar: if the planet doesn’t cross any of the starspots, then it blocks a larger fraction of the bright light, and so the transit will appear deeper than it should given the planet’s size -> you will infer that the planet is larger than it is.  Showed an example where there was a 4% difference in radius, and 12% difference in density.  This is also wavelength-dependent: in optical, spots are very dark.  But not as much a problem in IR . . . so can resolve this issue by looking at NIR; spectroscopy with IGRINS gives the T_eff of the spots, which gives you the spot coverage fraction.

**Sharon Wang** - RVxK2 - simultaneous Kepler photometry and RVs to help mitigate stellar jitter.  Stellar jitter is the bottleneck for detecting Earth analogs.  The idea is that RV variations and photometric variations are similar in timescale and amplitude (have used GPs trained on photometry to help with RV activity).  Simultaneous observations happened for C16; ground-based used APF, IRFT, MINERVA, Keck, Magellan.  Many aspects of stellar jitter; she talked particularly about oscillations.  Usually mitigated in RVs by averaging, but doesn’t get down to 30 cm/s . . . so why don’t you model it instead?  Yes!!  Did this for a sub-giant; used GPs (celerite) with the same underlying model trained on photometry, only one more free parameter, get down to 0.8 cm/s.  Doing this again with TESS.

**Lisa Bugnet** - FliPer, a tool to detect and characterize solar-like pulsators.  Classifying all Kepler, K2, TESS stars by extending Fabienne’s flicker to the entire power spectrum.  Using entire spectrum allows you to go to much lower logg using the granulation signal.  Oscillators (solar-like acoustic modes, delta-scuti, cepheids, etc) also have unique power spectra.  Uses a random forest for the classification between solar-like oscillations, classical pulsators, and binaries.  Trained on 1600 stars; tested on 400; get ~90% accurate classifications for solar-like oscillations; ~80% for classical pulsators.  Then applied to 136000 Kepler stars.  Working on K2 and TESS.

**Courtney Dressing** - frequency of planetary systems in Kepler & K2.  Overview talk; started with pre-Kepler radius distribution.  Talked about radius distribution as a function of period, stellar type, metallicity (look again at Petigura et al. 2018 - updates earlier work).  Her group is working on statistics with K2.

**Gijs Mulders** - Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator (EPOS - code available) to apply forward model of Kepler detection filter to output of theoretical simulations (also computes data-centric occurrence rates).  Incorporates both Kepler data and RV data . . . check out Fernandes paper in press for occurrence rate of giant planets (from HARPS?); also compares to the Bern planet population synthesis models.  Applying his EPOS code to the Bern models, he sees that the frequency of Jupiters and close-in super-Earths match-ish Kepler (using large boxes, within a factor of 2).  Exception is sub-Neptunes - Bern model underpredicts abundance of them by factor of ~5.  Also discusses multi-planet statistics, comparison between models and Kepler.  See that sub-Neptunes in model too close to their stars.  Also find that systems are dynamically cold (which produces more planet cores in model).

**Tim Morton** - probabilistic validation - the revolution enabled by Kepler.  Probabilistic validation started with Kepler-9 d.  Did not have a mass measurement.  Then Kepler 22b, validated by BLENDER.  Then his 2012 paper, predicting <10% false positive rate.  Then computed false positive probabilities for entire Kepler catalog and validated >1200 new planets (2016 paper)

**Marko Sestovic** - planet occurrence rates around ultracool dwarfs (like TRAPPIST-1).  Large gap in T_eff from TRAPPIST-1 to other M-dwarf planets.  611 ultracool stars observed by K2, 445 spectrographically confirmed.  Model occurrence rate with an inhomogeneous poisson process that incorporates completeness via transit injections (can recover 6 of the 7 TRAPPIST planets, but couldn’t find planets around any of the other ultracool stars, so will only get upper limits).  Conclude that finding TRAPPIST-1 planets was lucky: if 100% of stars have TRAPPIST-like systems, would have 73% chance of finding one.  If 20%, have 23% chance; if 5%, 6.3% chance; if 1%, have 1.3% chance . . . for the completeness-corrected marginal radius distribution, get ~10 planets/star at 1 R_Earth, but that’s just because their entire sample is dominated by one system.

**Christina Hedges** - are there more planets in K2?  Dotson et al. 2018: if apply Kepler-prime occurrence rates to K2, we haven’t found all of the planets that are there.  Where are they hiding?  Instrument systematics?  Have only been searching for strictly periodic signals?  Stellar variability? crowded field?  multi-planet search biases? no homogeneous search yet?  Highlights 3 specific systems.  github.com/christinahedges/KepSciCon2019 - the Jupyter notebooks that her results are based on.  Detrending codes used in various community efforts: K2SFF (Vanderburg; self-flat fielding), EVEREST (Luger; pixel-level decomposition), K2SC (Aigrain; using gaussian processes).  None of these methods work for all stars.  Example: K2-43b - short-term noise important, EVEREST does better than K2SFF.  There’s another planet hiding in there.  Another example: K2-168; another extra planet.  Her suggestions: vary detrending method and parameters to ensure a complete search; remove stellar variability carefully; check harmonics for hiding resonant planets.

### Tuesday, March 5

**Sarah Ballard** - overview of Multi-planet systems, including Kepler 9, 11, 32, 36, 19 & 46 (detections of non-transiting planets from TTVs), 20 & 42 (first Earth-sized planets), 186 & 62 (the habitable zone ~Earth-sized planets, just around smaller stars).  She explicitly mentions the TTV vs. RV density difference as being interesting to get to the bottom of.

**Chris Shallue** - deep learning to find Earth analogs.  (!!! He says that today’s neural networks are able to distinguish between Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies!!)  Their detetion pipeline recovers more injected planets around Sun-like stars . . . because probing lower SNR, will have more false positives, so need automatic vetting . . . this is where the deep learning comes in (their vetting DNN is called AstroNet).  Obtain 96% accuracy on signals from Kepler.  Found two new planets: Kepler-80g and Kepler-90i.  Have also applies AstroNet for K2, and discovered two new planets.  AstroNet is also performing triage in MIT’s Quick-look pipeline.  Long-period false positives are challenging because don’t have many of those in the training set.

**Michelle Hill** - Kepler Giant planets in the habitable zone (NOTE: their definition of giants are 3-25 R_Earth).  Around G dwarfs, 6.5% +/-1.9; around K, 11.5% +/- 3.1; around M, 6% +/- 6 (versus ~1-20% for Earth-size planets in the habitable zone).  Interested in this for habitable moons around these planets.  Also looked at angular separation between giant planet and moon for direct imaging - need ~0.01-4 milliarcsec.  Then looked at actual giant planets in habitable zones found via RVs, find many linear trends (so farther out companions) - how does this affect formation of potentially habitable moons?

**Kai Rodenbeck** - revisiting exomoon around Kepler-1625 b (even different than the paper I discussed at the arXiv discussion a few weeks ago). Points out issue with enormous size of proposed moon.  They ask: 1) can they reproduce findings of Teachey 2018?  2) How robust is this to detrending/stellar noise?  Do injections with *and* without moon.  Use four differen detrending functions and two cut-off conditions.  There is 10-20% chance of detecting a moon if no moon was injected; 30-40% chance of detecting an injected moon.  They find that the false positives were close to the properties of the injected transits, especially using the detrending method closest to what Teachey used.

**Ashley Chontos** - KOI-4: confirming Kepler’s first exoplanet detection.  KOI-4 is listed as a false positive early on, but Robovetter reclassified it as planet candidate.  Stellar properties were wrong - is actually a subgiant, so planet is Jupiter-sized.  This planet was then confirmed via RVs (Kepler-1658 b).  Combined fit shows massive hot Jupiter with mild eccentricity.  Occupies a unique area of host radius vs. period space.  Good target for observing orbital period decay!  Over time span of Kepler, no evidence of period decay, which constrans the tidal Q of the star to be > 4e3.

**Andrew Vanderburg** - benchmark systems from K2.  Starting with systems that are ameniable to ground-based follow-up: K2-3, many others that are part of Hubble follow-up survey.  Brightest planet-hosting stars: planets around giants like HD73344.  Particularly highlighted HD 106315 - doppler tomography used to assess spin-orbit alignment.  Also TRAPPIST-1, K2-19 (very close to 3:2 resonance), WASP-47 with ultra-short period e, hot jupiter, smaller planet at 9 days, and long-period giant from RV - dynamical analyses show that has to have orderly architecture.  Next start about extreme K2 systems: utra-short-period planets like K2-137 (P=4.3 hours; planet must be very elongated, like football, and heavily iron-enhanced), K2-141 (has phase curves indicating reflected light, or is very very hot blackbody).  Also very long periods (single-transit systems): EPIC 248847494 b (P~10 years given transit duration), microlensing planet OGLE-2016-BLG-1190Lb that has K2 data.  Young planets: planets detected in Hyades (Mann 2016), Taurus (De Martin 2019), Upper Scorpius (David 2016).  Old planets: jupiters around evolved giants (Grunblatt).  Disintegrating planets: K2-22 and WD 1145+017, add to the 2 found in the original Kepler mission.  Also citizen science - find many single-transit events, also found K2_288 Bb (one transit found at beginning of data, which is usually clipped out), K2-138 (resonant chain).

**Juliette Becker** - dynamically determining planet parameters that are observationally ill-constrained.  Conclusions: use a baseline prior incorporating that you’re more likely to see short-period planets transit; use dynamical constraints - they help!; and use legacy data.  HIP 41378, 5-planet system, need to constrain outer two planets d and f (bright star, good multiplanet system for future observations, a transiting cold jupiter - RVs + transmission spectroscopy!!); observed in C5 and C18 (big gap in the middle).  Also had data from KELT, WASP, and HAT (legacy data!!).  Computed stability + used before-mentioned prior + knowledge that integer number of periods must have occurred, get a list of possible periods ordered by probability that those are the true period.  f deep enough to be observed from ground - using these surveys, ruled out many shorter possible periods.  e does not transit again in C18, so can rule out periods, but not as well constrained as d and f.  Doing this really helps to guide follow-up observations.

**Kevin Hardegree-Ullman** - Spitzer follow-up of K2 targets (results from program PI Mike Werner, 68 observations between 2015-2018).  Looked at 35 K2 planets.  Targets span range in orbital period, radius, and stellar T_eff.  Spitzer really helped lock down ephemerides for K2-3.  K2-55 b - dense Neptune around high metallicity K star.  HD3167 - good target for atmospheric observations.  K2-288 Bb - very different transit depths between K2 and Spitzer, due to dilution of companion: less dilution at longer wavelengths, so planet likely to be orbiting the smaller star!  K2-138 - 5, maybe 6 planets?  Confirmed planet #6 with Spitzer!!  Cool video by Matt Russo sonifying the resonance of this system; can hear the slight out-of-resonance today versus during formation (system-sounds.com).  Many of these planets are sub-Neptune in size . . .

**Joey Rodriguez** - K2-226: a compact multiplanet system with some planets misaligned by ~10 degrees from the others (based on transit shape).  2 validated, 2 confirmed planets, 2 candidates.  System is stable, but luckily so.  There’s also a co-moving (from Gaia) stellar companion separated by 42 arcsec.  There’s an 8.5-day planet candidate around the *other* star!  Another example of this: TOI-125, misaligned by 15-20 degrees!

**Fei Dai** - ultra-short-period planets.  Unique science with them: tidal evolution, thermal emission/surface reflectivity, star-planet magnetic interactions, atmospheric erosion.  Look at hot Neptune desert as a function of stellar type: M-dwarfs are more effective at clearing out the desert (and mid-late M hosts even more) than GK dwarfs - points to photoevaporation over core-powered mass loss.  Also look at composition of USPs - best chance of constraining the composition of Earth-sized planets in near future because devoid of H/He envelope, so less degeneracy.  Do a uniform analysis of USP planets: used F>650 days as definition of USP instead of P<1 day.  Applied GP regression to data.  Error bars on radius and mass shrunk; better constraints on composition.  Split into period bins - match with period distribution from Lee & Chang, 2017.  Some connection to magnetic truncation of disk, secular theory . . . then looked at mutual inclination as a function of orbital distance (Dai+ 2018).  Larger mutual inclinations for closer-in planets.  Also larger mutual inclinations with larger period ratio (dynamically separated from outer system).  Is this an explanation for the Kepler dichotomy?  Weiss 2018 showed that the overabundance of single-transiting systems only present for periods < 3 days.
